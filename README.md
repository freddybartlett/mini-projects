## maths-game.py

The code for this program is in "maths-game.py" in this repo. This program consists of a basic maths game that generates maths problems for addition, subtraction, multiplication and division. The user can then enter how long they can do the problems for, after which the game starts. The program keeps prompting the user randomly generated questions until the timer runs out (as set by the user previously). The program then displays how many questions the user got right, and then displays the users score (for every question correct you get 1 point, for every wrong question you lose a point).
